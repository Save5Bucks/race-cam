## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### `config.lua`

This file is where the magic happens. Each camera angle is fully customizable with the following options:

```lua
Config.CameraSettings = {
    [1] = {coords = {x = 0.0, y = 0.0, z = 1.0}, rotation = {pitch = -10.0, yaw = 0.0}, fov = 45.0},
    [2] = {coords = {x = 0.0, y = -0.5, z = 1.0}, rotation = {pitch = -10.0, yaw = 0.0}, fov = 45.0},
    [3] = {coords = {x = 0.0, y = -1.0, z = 1.0}, rotation = {pitch = -10.0, yaw = 0.0}, fov = 45.0},
    [4] = {coords = {x = 0.0, y = -3.5, z = 1.0}, rotation = {pitch = -10.0, yaw = 0.0}, fov = 45.0},
    [5] = {coords = {x = 0.0, y = -4.5, z = 1.0}, rotation = {pitch = -10.0, yaw = 0.0}, fov = 45.0},
    [6] = {coords = {x = 0.0, y = -7.0, z = 1.5}, rotation = {pitch = -15.0, yaw = 0.0}, fov = 45.0}
}

Config.CommandName = "racecam"
```

- **`coords`**: Position of the camera relative to the vehicle.
- **`rotation`**: Initial pitch and yaw of the camera.
- **`fov`**: Field of view for each camera.

## üéÆ Usage

Once your server is running, you can easily switch between the custom camera angles using the following command:

```plaintext
/racecam [1-6]
```

- **Example**: `/racecam 1` activates the first custom camera angle.

Each camera is carefully designed to give you a thrilling and immersive driving experience, following your vehicle as it moves across all planes.

## üîß Features

- **Dynamic Camera Follow**: The camera dynamically follows the vehicle's pitch, roll, and yaw, ensuring the view is always in sync with the vehicle's orientation.
- **6 Customizable Angles**: Pre-configured with 6 different camera angles, fully customizable in the `config.lua` file.
- **Real-Time Adjustments**: Camera updates in real-time, reflecting all vehicle movements instantly.
